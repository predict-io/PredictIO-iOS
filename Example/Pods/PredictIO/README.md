## Requirements
* [Sign up](http://www.predict.io/sdk-sign-up/) for API key
* iOS 7.0+
* ARC

## Installation
### Using CocoaPods
[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. Copy and paste the following lines into your podfile:
```ruby
platform :ios, '7.0'
pod 'PredictIO'
```
> You should not use TextEdit to edit the podfile because TextEdit likes to replace standard quotes with more graphically appealing quotes. This can cause CocoaPods to get confused and display errors, so itâ€™s best to just use Xcode or another programming text editor.

### If not using CocoaPods
If you don't use CocoaPods, you can manually add predict.io lib to your Xcode project, check the [Manual Integration Guide](https://github.com/predict-io/PredictIO-iOS/wiki/Manual-integration-of-predict.io) for more details.

### Example
To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

### Getting Location Events in the Background
predict.io requires location updates even when your application is in the background. Check out [Getting Location Events in the Background](https://github.com/predict-io/PredictIO-iOS/wiki/Getting-Location-Events-in-the-Background) for more details.
